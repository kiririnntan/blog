			What the title says.

		<p>
		I don't felt like doing anything today. I felt numb. My passive suicidal ideation have been there for years but I barely do anything about it. It's felt empty and hopeless and there's nothing I could do. Except there is things I could do. I could apply for a job. I could learn some usable skills such as data analytics. I could cook and clean. But my body wanted to completely reject it. Funny how life works sometime.

		So I choose to reinstall arch on my playground laptop and do some hyprland config. And also some nvim config. It was okay I guess. I like sitting in front of my computer doing nothing so it's cool.

	I don't know. I really wish I am not here right now.
